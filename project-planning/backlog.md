# Backlog of Practical Javascript

Everything (all web apps) is a TODO list!!
In this one application we can learn all main things you need to develop software in the browser.
_Every application is pretty much a to-do list._

Sample used here is from: [todomvc](todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/)

## Must-Have Features

> these are necessary for basic usability

- [ ] As a ... I want to ... so that ...
  - _Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]_

1. CREATE & ADD: Ability to create and add/STORE a todo/an item
2. READ/RETRIEVE: Ability to SHOW/DISPLAY/ACCESS/REFERENCE the created/added todo item
2. **TOGGLE SINGLE**: Ability to toggle a single item: to mark it, and click again to reset it back to the original state
3. **TOGGLE ALL**: Ability to toggle all items at once
4. UPDATE/EDIT: Ability to CHANGE a todo/ an item
5. DELETE/DESTROY: Ability to REMOVE a todo/ an item

## Should-Haves Additional Secondary Features

6. Total number of items display, buttons -all, active, completed, clear
7. LOCAL STORAGE: saves the data even after refreshing the page

> these will complete the user experience, but are not necessary

- [ ] As a ... I want to ... so that ...
  - _Given [context] when [a specific action is performed] then [a set of consequences should occur]_

## Could-Haves

> would be really cool to mimic this [todo in js, es6, node, etc](http://todomvc.com), if there's time, for ui/ux and to learn other languages/formats.

- [ ] As a user I want to have a nice UI/UX so that I can use the app
  - _Given html template when I open the app then nice visuals and interaction should show up _

## Examples of other 'todo lists'

- Google structure is like a todo list, instead of todos, we have search results, 
- Amazon or shopping site, or ecommerce sites, when looking for shoes, you get shoe1, shoe2, a bunch of choices that are products , but structure of application is similar to todo list
- Facebook and Twitter feeds are similar to to-do list, where you have tweet1, tweet2, tweet 3, etc
- All web applications fit this structure - todo list. eg list of books, list of tutorials,
- Email where there is message1, message2, etc, as message list, just like a todo list.
  You can also do things like: select individual message and mark it as complete, or archive it, or whatever. You can select entire list and do actions on the list. To do list has same features - almost identical
- Chat applications like Slack is like a todo list. The only difference is that the form is on the bottom instead of the top.
